## CNN Siamese Model is used to obtain feature

## representation of images and compare the real image with

## test image using Euclidean Distance Calculation


## WebApp

## Flask is used as the Backend framework and socketio

## Is used for data communication.


**Future Development Goals**
1.More improved Accuracy of models
2.Face Recognition along with Signature for 2-level
authentication
3.Rest API


**Reference**
The major development and intuition of the project is based on
SigNet Research Paper
