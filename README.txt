################################## Our View ###########################################

We built this web app with the mindset of thinking of Axis Bank representatives as its end user. It consists of two main function:- 1) Add a new user and his/her signature:- Signature along with user details in the database 2) Verify signature:- the Real signature will be fetched from the database and will be compared with the test signature. We build a siemese network and output the Euclidian Distance between feature vectors of both signatures.


################################# Technical Stack #######################################

These are the techs helping us to make this project works properly
	1> Flask (Python server) for backend.
	2> Keras (Tensorflow Backend)
	3> Bootstrap. (For designing)
	4> Jquery
	5> Cropper.js for crop the image for signature  (Addon feature).
	6> Socket.io ( For Asynchronous communication )
-- : None of these tech are paid or api based all are open source : -- 

################################# About Project ########################################

This is web based application developed in ( Flask & JS ), with custom signature recognition models 
(trained in-house).The WebApp is not completely offline it require internet connection for content distribute 
network (CDNs) because to decrease the size of project we have to use CDNs instead of js packages.


** IMPORTANT**  ===> ( For AI trained models internet is not required its completely OFFLINE  )
